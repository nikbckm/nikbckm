# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I believe that product managers should understand (the basics of) the tech that they're working with. That's why I am here to learn. :)

I'm a data analyst and product manager with a strong passion for programming, data management, and ... football! I'm currently enhancing my expertise through a Master's program in Data Management.
